My advanced web applications project

# Dev

To run the backend, simply go to the root directory of the project and first download all dependencies with "npm i" and then run the server with
"npm run start". Remember to create an .env file with a "SECRET" and a "DB" variable with the url of your MongoDB database.

To run the frontend, cd into the "app" directory and again download all dependencies with "npm i" and then simply type the command "npm run dev"
